        <h3>Green Rambles: How Straps Elevate Your Wrist Game</h3></a>
        <p>Looks are only part of the equation, as wearing comfort is another. When a strap does not sit 
          comfortably around your wrist, it reflects on the watch as a whole. What often happens is that 
          you simply wear it less, even when the watch itself is great. A mere strap change can make a 
          difference. While I am an avid advocate of buying quality, getting the right strap does not 
          always have to cost an arm and a leg.</p>

        <h3>Did You Know That: A Tourbillon Is Not A Complication</h3></a>
        <p>Many still think that the tourbillon is a complication. While it is most certainly complex to 
        make, it is an addition to the escapement of the watch. As this is an essential piece of a mechanical 
        watch, it does not count as a complication. In this same light is also a remontoire, or the co-axial 
        escapement invented by George Daniels, not a complication, while they do require considerable expertise 
        to make.</p>
