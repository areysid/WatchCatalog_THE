    <h2>Watch Care Tips</h2>
    <p>Proper care and maintenance can extend the life of your watch and keep it looking its best. Proper 
        care and maintenance play a crucial role in extending the lifespan of your watch and preserving its 
        original beauty and functionality. By implementing a consistent care routine, you not only ensure 
        that your timepiece continues to accurately keep time but also safeguard its value and aesthetic 
        appeal over time. 
        <br>
        Here are some tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>➜  Regularly</span> clean your watch with a soft cloth to remove dirt, sweat, and oils.</li>

      <li><span>➜  Ensure</span> your watch is water-resistant and follow manufacturer guidelines for water exposure.</li>
